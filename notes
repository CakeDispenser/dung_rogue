MAPGEN PROCESS:
# For now it is very simple and quite buggy, but it's already playable.
# I want to make at least a somewhat playable pre-alpha of the game, so that's fine for now.
1. Generate rooms
1.1. Choose random coordinate, which would allow to generate a room NOT outside the borders of the map. +
1.2. Check if there is no room already there. +
1.3. If there is no room, then fill the space from the coordinate to right-bottom corner according to random room width and height. +
1.4. Build the walls +
1.5. Make a dictionary with rooms and potential door placements for each room. +/-
2. Generate corridors
2.1. Choose a room closest to the topleft corner. +
2.2. Choose a room closest to it +
2.3. Look for potential doors places in rooms' dictionaries, choose the places which are the closest. -
2.4. Build a corridor between these two places. +
2.5. Build doors. +/-
2.6. Repeat with the second chosen room as main room until every room is connected +

# PLAYER CLASS
Player will be made as a class...
Actually, every creature should be made as a class? -
Then, yea, Player would probably be a subclass of Creature. +

Creatures will have attributes:
Strength - determines carryable weight?, damage with melee weapons, armor penetration?
Dexterity - determines chance to dodge. Damage with ranged weapons.
Vitality - determines stamina, max HP, HP regeneration rate
Intelligence - used for magic purposes. May identify equipment passively.
Perception? - crit chance, chance to hit, crit dmg?

Creatures will also have combat stats:
Weapon damage - percentage to weapon damage which will affect damage of equipped weapon
Accuracy - percentage, chance to hit a target with no other effects (like dodge)
Dodge - basically, a penalty to enemies' accuracy
Armor penetration? - ability to penetrate armor and deal damage through it?
# Armor will block some damage, but armor penetration will allow some of the blocked damage to pass through
HP - health
Stamina - energy of the creature. Used for combat maneuvers and skills.
Mana? - magic energy, used alongside Stamina? to cast spells

TRANSFER UPDATE TO STATS TO ACCORDING METHODS, SO THAT THEY UPDATE ONLY WHEN CHANGED WITH THESE METHODS +?
I'm stupidooooooo. I have made the regeneration mechanics depend on real-time, but the game is running in turns! +

FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE NORMAL LIGHT! (blit dark screen everywhere except an area around the player) +
probably done, but it may get laggy... (redone, so that it's not that laggy)
COME UP WITH A WAY TO REDRAW ONLY CHANGING TILES! I guess i have done it? +

Equipment:
Equipment will have different levels.
For example: hatchet (axe level 1), hand axe (level 2), war axe (level 3).

ALL ITEMS stats:
1. Weight - in kilograms

Weapons will have following stats:
1. Damage - how much base damage the weapon does.
2. Accuracy - modifier to creature accuracy with this weapon. Heavier weapons will have worse accuracy.
3. Strength req - requirement of Strength attribute to use this weapon.
4. Weapon type - type of the weapon like: axe, sword, mace...
5. Hands - one-handed or two-handed
6. Level - level of the weapon as described above.
7. Rarity - it is described below

I think I should make a weapon class?
So, the stats in the dictionary will be templates for objects of this class.

Some of weapons and armor will have enchantments, special effects that will alter/upgrade the equipment in some way.
For example, Uncommon War Axe of Frost will deal 75% damage as physical and 25% damage as frost.

Items with enchantments will have different rarities/qualities:
Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, (Unique?)
These rarities will make the enchantments better
OR
These rarities will determine the max amount of enchantments. maybe if the same enchantment is on the same weapon it will get stronger?

List of Enchantments:
Frost - some of the damage will be cold, chance to freeze
Fire - some of the damage will be fire, chance to burn
Acid - some of the damage will be acidic, chance to melt armor
Shock - some of the damage will be electrical, chance to stun?
Quadrimental - combining all 4 elementals
Sharp - chance to inflict bleeding
Injuring - chance to inflict injury,
Berserking - chance to make the wielder berserk, which would
Vampiric - life steal
Leeching? - drains strength from the enemy, inflicting weakness on them and strength on the wielder
